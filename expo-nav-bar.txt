Expo NavigationBar




Ask AI

A library that provides access to various interactions with the native navigation bar on Android.

Bundled version:
~5.0.9

Copy page

expo-navigation-bar enables you to modify and observe the native navigation bar on Android devices. Due to some Android platform restrictions, parts of this API overlap with the expo-status-bar API.

Properties are named after style properties; visibility, position, backgroundColor, borderColor, and so on.

The APIs in this package have no impact when "Gesture Navigation" is enabled on the Android device. There is currently no native Android API to detect if "Gesture Navigation" is enabled or not.

Installation
Terminal

Copy

npx expo install expo-navigation-bar
If you are installing this in an existing React Native app, make sure to install expo in your project.

Configuration in app config
You can configure expo-navigation-bar using its built-in config plugin if you use config plugins in your project (Continuous Native Generation (CNG)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does not use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

Example app.json with config plugin
app.json

Configurable properties
Name	Default	Description
backgroundColor	undefined	
Sets the navigation bar background color. Accepts color string supported by React Native. For example, "#0f172a".

barStyle	undefined	
Controls whether Android renders light or dark navigation bar buttons. Accepts light and dark as values.

borderColor	undefined	
Sets the divider color above the navigation bar.

visibility	undefined	
Determines whether the navigation bar starts visible or hidden. Accepts visible to show the bar immediately and hidden to hide it until the user reveals it with a system gesture.

behavior	undefined	
Controls how hidden system bars behave when revealed. Accepts overlay-swipe, inset-swipe, or inset-touch as values.

position	undefined	
Sets whether your layout is inset for the navigation bar. Accepts relative to keep the navigation bar outside the content and absolute to draw the content edge-to-edge under the bar.

legacyVisible	undefined	
Legacy equivalent of androidNavigationBar.visible. Accepts leanback, immersive, or sticky-immersive as values.

API
import * as NavigationBar from 'expo-navigation-bar';
Hooks
useVisibility()
React hook that statefully updates with the visibility of the system navigation bar.

Returns:
NavigationBarVisibility | null
Visibility of the navigation bar, null during async initialization.

Example

function App() {
  const visibility = NavigationBar.useVisibility()
  // React Component...
}
Methods
NavigationBar.getBackgroundColorAsync()
Gets the navigation bar's background color.

This method is supported only when edge-to-edge is disabled.

Returns:
Promise<string>
Current navigation bar color in hex format. Returns #00000000 (transparent) on unsupported platforms (iOS, web).

Example

const color = await NavigationBar.getBackgroundColorAsync();
NavigationBar.getBehaviorAsync()
Gets the behavior of the status and navigation bars when the user swipes or touches the screen.

This method is supported only when edge-to-edge is disabled.

Returns:
Promise<NavigationBarBehavior>
Navigation bar interaction behavior. Returns inset-touch on unsupported platforms (iOS, web).

Example

await NavigationBar.getBehaviorAsync()
NavigationBar.getBorderColorAsync()
Gets the navigation bar's top border color, also known as the "divider color".

This method is supported only when edge-to-edge is disabled.

Returns:
Promise<string>
Navigation bar top border color in hex format. Returns #00000000 (transparent) on unsupported platforms (iOS, web).

Example

const color = await NavigationBar.getBorderColorAsync();
NavigationBar.getButtonStyleAsync()
Gets the navigation bar's button color styles.

This method is supported only when edge-to-edge is disabled.

Returns:
Promise<NavigationBarButtonStyle>
Navigation bar foreground element color settings. Returns light on unsupported platforms (iOS, web).

Example

const style = await NavigationBar.getButtonStyleAsync();
NavigationBar.getVisibilityAsync()
Get the navigation bar's visibility.

Returns:
Promise<NavigationBarVisibility>
Navigation bar's current visibility status. Returns hidden on unsupported platforms (iOS, web).

Example

const visibility = await NavigationBar.getVisibilityAsync("hidden");
NavigationBar.setBackgroundColorAsync(color)
Parameter	Type	Description
color	string	
Any valid CSS 3 (SVG) color.


Changes the navigation bar's background color.

This method is supported only when edge-to-edge is disabled.

Returns:
Promise<void>
Example

NavigationBar.setBackgroundColorAsync("white");
NavigationBar.setBehaviorAsync(behavior)
Parameter	Type	Description
behavior	NavigationBarBehavior	
Dictates the interaction behavior of the navigation bar.


Sets the behavior of the status bar and navigation bar when they are hidden and the user wants to reveal them.

For example, if the navigation bar is hidden (setVisibilityAsync(false)) and the behavior is 'overlay-swipe', the user can swipe from the bottom of the screen to temporarily reveal the navigation bar.

'overlay-swipe': Temporarily reveals the System UI after a swipe gesture (bottom or top) without insetting your App's content.
'inset-swipe': Reveals the System UI after a swipe gesture (bottom or top) and insets your App's content (Safe Area). The System UI is visible until you explicitly hide it again.
'inset-touch': Reveals the System UI after a touch anywhere on the screen and insets your App's content (Safe Area). The System UI is visible until you explicitly hide it again.
This method is supported only when edge-to-edge is disabled.

Returns:
Promise<void>
Example

await NavigationBar.setBehaviorAsync('overlay-swipe')
NavigationBar.setBorderColorAsync(color)
Parameter	Type	Description
color	string	
Any valid CSS 3 (SVG) color.


Changes the navigation bar's border color.

This method is supported only when edge-to-edge is disabled.

Returns:
Promise<void>
Example

NavigationBar.setBorderColorAsync("red");
NavigationBar.setButtonStyleAsync(style)
Parameter	Type	Description
style	NavigationBarButtonStyle	
Dictates the color of the foreground element color.


Changes the navigation bar's button colors between white (light) and a dark gray color (dark).

Returns:
Promise<void>
Example

NavigationBar.setButtonStyleAsync("light");
NavigationBar.setPositionAsync(position)
Parameter	Type	Description
position	NavigationBarPosition	
Based on CSS position property.


Sets positioning method used for the navigation bar (and status bar). Setting position absolute will float the navigation bar above the content, whereas position relative will shrink the screen to inline the navigation bar.

When drawing behind the status and navigation bars, ensure the safe area insets are adjusted accordingly.

This method is supported only when edge-to-edge is disabled.

Returns:
Promise<void>
Example

// enables edge-to-edge mode
await NavigationBar.setPositionAsync('absolute')
// transparent backgrounds to see through
await NavigationBar.setBackgroundColorAsync('#ffffff00')
NavigationBar.setStyle(style)
Parameter	Type
style	NavigationBarStyle

Sets the style of the navigation bar.

This will have an effect when the following conditions are met:

Edge-to-edge is enabled
The enforceNavigationBarContrast option of the react-native-edge-to-edge plugin is set to false.
The device is using the three-button navigation bar.
Due to a bug in the Android 15 emulator this function may have no effect. Try a physical device or an emulator with a different version of Android.

Returns:
void
NavigationBar.setVisibilityAsync(visibility)
Parameter	Type	Description
visibility	NavigationBarVisibility	
Based on CSS visibility property.


Set the navigation bar's visibility.

Returns:
Promise<void>
Example

NavigationBar.setVisibilityAsync("hidden");
NavigationBar.unstable_getPositionAsync()
Whether the navigation and status bars float above the app (absolute) or sit inline with it (relative). This value can be incorrect if androidNavigationBar.visible is used instead of the config plugin position property.

This method is unstable because the position can be set via another native module and get out of sync. Alternatively, you can get the position by measuring the insets returned by react-native-safe-area-context.

This method is supported only when edge-to-edge is disabled.

Returns:
Promise<NavigationBarPosition>
Navigation bar positional rendering mode. Returns relative on unsupported platforms (iOS, web).

Example

await NavigationBar.unstable_getPositionAsync()
Event Subscriptions
NavigationBar.addVisibilityListener(listener)
Parameter	Type
listener	(event: NavigationBarVisibilityEvent) => void

Observe changes to the system navigation bar. Due to platform constraints, this callback will also be triggered when the status bar visibility changes.

Returns:
EventSubscription
Example

NavigationBar.addVisibilityListener(({ visibility }) => {
  // ...
});
