Kadmawala — Product Requirements Document
 (PRD)
 Project: Kadmawala Sales & CRM System
 Client: Kadmawala (PNG Team)
 Owner: Ofstartup
 Version: 1.0
 Date: 2025-11-11
 1. Executive Summary
 Kadmawala requires a unified field-sales mobile application for their sales force and a complementary
 web-based Admin Panel for managers. The system will digitize dealer→retailer→farmer relationships,
 enable GPS/photo-verified visits (check-in/check-out), capture structured agricultural and commercial data,
 and provide CRM-style reminders and analytics to increase adoption of Kadmawala feed products.
 The deliverable is a product that supports: real-time visit logging, hierarchical data (Dealer → Retailer →
 Farmer), dynamic forms for animal & feed data, automated reminders, offline-first data capture, and an
 Admin Portal for monitoring, reporting, and insight generation.
 Goals: - Improve field sales effectiveness and accountability. - Increase retailer demand and farmer
 awareness for Kadmawala feed. - Produce measurable KPIs to guide marketing and distribution decisions.
 2. Scope & Objectives
 In-scope (Phase 1): - Mobile app for Salespeople (Android/iOS): authentication, check-in/out, visit forms
 (Dealer, Retailer, Farmer), photo & GPS capture, reminders, offline capability. - Admin Web Panel: user
 management, view records, search & filters, reporting export, dashboards (visits, adoption, region
 performance), CRM calendar. - Data model linking Dealer→Retailer→Farmer with sub-entities (Animals,
 Feed entries, Brands). - Basic analytics and CSV export.
 Out-of-scope (Phase 1): - Complex BI pipelines, external ERP integrations, payment flows, marketplace
 features, automated messaging (SMS/WhatsApp) — may be Phase 2.

Success Metrics: - 90% of field visits recorded with GPS + photo within first 60 days. - 30% increase in

 9. Business Logic & Calculators
 Farmer Nutrition / Cost Calculator - Inputs: ready_made_feed_kg_per_day, natural_feed_kg_per_day,
 feed_brand_nutrition_score, cost_ready_per_kg, milk_per_day_per_animal
 • 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Derived:
 total_feed_kg = ready_made_feed_kg_per_day + natural_feed_kg_per_day
 nutrition_value = weighted_sum(brand_nutrition * qty) + natural_nutrition
 cost_per_day_per_animal = total_feed_kg * cost_ready_per_kg (plus estimated cost of natural)
 projected_milk_increase = function(nutrition_value)
 monetary_benefit = (projected_milk_increase * milk_price) - (cost_diff)
 Retailer Feed Share Calculation - For a retailer, sum quantity of all brands (MT/month). Kadmawala Share =
 kadmawala_mt / total_mt.
 10. Non-functional Requirements
 Performance - App should load Today’s Work within 2s on average mobile networks.
 Availability - Backend uptime 99.5% (exempting scheduled maintenance).
 6
Security - JWT auth, HTTPS everywhere, role-based access, S3 or equivalent for media with presigned URLs.
 Compliance & Privacy - Store only necessary personal data; phone numbers encrypted at rest.
 Scalability - Design for 1,000 active salespeople and 100k entity records in Phase 1. Use pagination and
 indexes for list APIs.
 11. Roadmap & Phases
 Phase 1 (MVP, 6–8 weeks) - Mobile app core (check-in/out, Dealer/Retailer/Farmer forms, offline sync) 
Admin Panel: basic dashboards, user mgmt, data explorer, CSV export - Feed & animal data capture, basic
 nutrition calculator
 Phase 2 (2–3 months after MVP) - Advanced analytics & heatmaps - Automated messaging (WhatsApp/
 SMS) for reminders and farm tips - Deeper BI and integrations (ERP, supply chain)
 Phase 3 (Future) - Predictive recommendations (which retailer to target next) - Incentive & commission
 module - In-app learning modules for farmers
 12. Acceptance Criteria
 The product will be accepted if: - Sales team can create and submit visits with GPS & photo in offline/online
 modes. - Admin can view and export the collected data by dealer/retailer/farmer. - Reminders are created
 and triggered for next meeting dates. - Nutrition calculator computes a basic daily cost and projected
 benefit for farmers.
 13. Risks & Mitigations
 Risk: Low adoption by sales team
 Mitigation: Simple forms, training sessions, incentivize early usage, offline support.
 Risk: Poor data quality (fake photos/GPS)
 Mitigation: Implement distance checks, random audits, and mandatory photos for new entities.
 Risk: Offline sync conflicts
 Mitigation: Timestamps + local precedence + admin conflict resolution UI.
